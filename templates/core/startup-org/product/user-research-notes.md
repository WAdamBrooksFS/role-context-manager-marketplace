**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Next User Interview:** [Date]
**Document Owner:** Product Co-founder / Founder

<!-- LLM: When helping with user research, encourage specificity and patterns. One interview = interesting. Five similar interviews = pattern. Ten = strong signal to act on. Push founders to talk to users weekly (ideally daily at this stage). The best product insights come from consistent customer conversations, not clever strategy. Ask: "What surprised you?" "What contradicts your assumptions?" "What are 3+ people saying the same thing about?" -->
