## Product Vision (30-Second Pitch)

**What We're Building:**

[In 2-3 sentences, describe what your product is and does]

<!-- Example: "A platform that lets developers add AI capabilities to their applications through simple APIs. No ML expertise required. Production-ready from day one." -->

**Who It's For:**

[Describe your target user/customer in 1-2 sentences]

<!-- Example: "Engineering teams at Series A-C startups (10-100 engineers) who want to add AI features to their SaaS products without hiring ML specialists." -->

**Why It Matters:**

[The core value proposition - why should they care?]

<!-- Example: "Ship AI features in days instead of months. No need to hire $300K/year ML engineers or become an ML expert." -->

---

## The Problem We Solve

### Customer Pain Points

**Primary Problem:**

[The main problem your product solves]

<!-- Example: "SaaS companies want to add AI features (search, recommendations, classification) but don't have ML expertise and can't afford to hire ML engineers who take 6+ months to recruit and cost $300K+/year." -->

**Secondary Problems:**

1. [Problem 2]
2. [Problem 3]

<!-- Example:
1. Existing AI/ML tools require deep technical expertise most developers don't have
2. Building AI features from scratch takes months and requires maintaining complex infrastructure
3. Using raw LLM APIs is easy for demos but hard to make production-ready
-->

### Current Alternatives (And Why They Fall Short)

**Alternative 1: [Solution]**
- How customers solve this today
- Why it's not good enough

<!-- Example:
**Alternative 1: Hire ML Engineers**
- Hiring specialized ML talent in-house
- Takes 6+ months, costs $300K+/year, requires ongoing management and infrastructure
-->

**Alternative 2: [Solution]**
- How customers solve this today
- Why it's not good enough

**Alternative 3: Do Nothing**
- Many delay AI features indefinitely
- Falling behind competitors, losing deals

## Our Solution

### What We Do

[Describe your product in simple terms. Use the "Jobs to be Done" framework: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]"]

<!-- Example: "When developers need to add AI capabilities to their product, they want a simple API they can integrate in minutes, so they can ship AI features without becoming ML experts or hiring specialized engineers." -->

### How It Works (Simple)

[3-5 step explanation of how someone uses your product]

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
4. [Step 4]
5. [Step 5]

<!-- Example:
1. Sign up and get API key (2 minutes)
2. Choose AI capability (search, recommendations, classification, etc.)
3. Add 5 lines of code to your app
4. Test in development environment
5. Deploy to production (it just works)
-->

### Core Features

-->

**Key Differentiators (What makes us better):**

1. **[Differentiator 1]** - [How we're different from alternatives]
2. **[Differentiator 2]** - [How we're different]
3. **[Differentiator 3]** - [How we're different]

<!-- Example:
1. **10x Faster** - Days to production instead of months
2. **Works Out-of-Box** - No ML expertise, model training, or infrastructure setup needed
3. **Platform Agnostic** - Works with any tech stack, no vendor lock-in

<!-- LLM: When helping with product overview, focus on clarity and customer understanding. Push founders to be specific: "Who exactly is this for?" "What specific problem do they have?" "Why will they choose you?" Vague answers indicate fuzzy thinking. Good product thinking is crisp and customer-centric. -->
