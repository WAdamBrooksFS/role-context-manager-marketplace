# Vision and Mission

<!-- LLM: For start-ups, keep this combined and concise. Vision should be aspirational (5-10 years), mission should be actionable (present day). Help founders articulate the "why" clearly. This is the foundation for strategy, OKRs, and fundraising. -->

## Purpose

Your vision and mission are the foundation of your company. They answer:
- **Vision**: Where are we going? (5-10 year aspirational future)
- **Mission**: Why do we exist today? (Present-day purpose)

This document guides all strategy, product, and fundraising decisions.

## Vision (Where We're Going)

**The Future We're Creating:**

[Describe the world you want to create in 5-10 years. Be aspirational but believable. 2-3 sentences max.]

<!-- Example: "A world where every developer can build AI-powered applications without needing a PhD in machine learning. Where AI is as accessible as using a database." -->

**How We'll Know We've Achieved It:**

[1-2 concrete indicators that your vision has been realized]

<!-- Example:
- 10 million developers building AI apps using our platform
- AI development time reduced from months to days
-->

---

## Mission (Why We Exist Today)

**What We Do:**

[Describe what your company does in plain language. 1-2 sentences. Your grandmother should understand this.]

<!-- Example: "We provide a platform that makes it easy for developers to add AI capabilities to their applications without needing deep expertise in machine learning." -->

**Who We Serve:**

[Describe your target customer/user. Be specific.]

<!-- Example: "Full-stack developers and engineering teams at startups and mid-size companies who want to add AI features without hiring specialized ML engineers." -->

**How We're Different:**

[Your unique approach or differentiation. Why you vs alternatives? 1-2 sentences.]

<!-- Example: "While others require ML expertise or lock you into their infrastructure, we provide simple APIs that work with any tech stack and don't require understanding transformers or neural networks." -->

---

## Core Values

<!-- LLM: Start-ups should have 3-5 core values max. These should be actionable ("Move fast and break things") not platitudes ("We value integrity"). Help founders identify values they actually live by, not aspirational ones. -->

[List 3-5 core values that guide how you work. Each should have a 1-sentence explanation of what it means in practice.]

**Example:**
1. **Speed over perfection** - Ship quickly, learn from customers, iterate based on reality
2. **Default to transparency** - Share information openly with team and customers
3. **Customer obsession** - Talk to users daily, build what they need, not what we think is cool

---

## Company Purpose (The "Why")

**Why This Matters:**

[Why is solving this problem important? What's at stake? 2-3 sentences about the impact of your mission.]

<!-- Example: "AI is the most transformative technology of our generation, but it's locked behind complexity that keeps 99% of developers from using it. If we can democratize AI development, we unlock millions of developers to create applications we can't yet imagine." -->

**Our Founder Story:**

[Optional: Brief story of why the founders started this company. What personal experience or insight led to this? 2-3 sentences.]

<!-- Example: "We built ML models at Google for 5 years and watched talented engineers struggle with the same problems repeatedly. We realized the tools were built for ML researchers, not developers. We left to build what we wished existed." -->

- **Vision** → Informs long-term strategy in `/strategic/strategy.md`
- **Mission** → Guides quarterly OKRs in `/strategic/objectives-and-key-results.md`
- **Values** → Shape team culture in `/operations/team-handbook.md`
- **Purpose** → Drives pitch deck narrative in `/fundraising/pitch-deck-guide.md`

## Reviewing and Updating

**Annual Review (every 12 months):**
- Is our vision still inspiring and believable?
- Does our mission reflect what we actually do today?
- Are we living our values, or are they aspirational lies?
- Has our understanding of the problem/solution evolved?

**When to Update:**
- Pivot or major strategic shift
- New co-founder joins who shapes company direction
- Customer feedback reveals we misunderstood the problem
- You can't explain your company in 1 sentence anymore

**Keep This Lean:**
This document should be scannable in 2 minutes. If it's longer, you've over-complicated it.

<!-- LLM: When helping founders complete this, ask clarifying questions: "Who is your customer in one sentence?" "What does the world look like if you succeed?" "What would make you quit and go back to your old job?" The answers reveal authentic vision/mission. Avoid generic corporate speak. -->
