# Company Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

<!-- LLM: For start-ups, keep this lean: 2-3 objectives max (not 5), 2-3 key results each (not 4). Focus on product-market fit metrics. Help founders choose metrics that actually matter for their stage: user growth, retention, revenue, or usage depth - not vanity metrics. Update monthly, not just quarterly. -->

**Status:** Living | **Update Frequency:** Quarterly (reviewed monthly)
**Primary Roles:** Founder/CEO, Co-founders, Early Team
**Related Documents:** `/strategic/strategy.md`, `/strategic/roadmap.md`, `/operations/metrics-dashboard.md`

## Purpose

OKRs align the team around 2-3 ambitious goals for the quarter. At your stage, these should focus on **finding and scaling product-market fit**.

**Start-Up Reality:**
- You'll probably miss some targets - that's okay, you're learning
- Update monthly as you learn from customers
- It's better to make progress on 1 objective than spread thin across 3

## How to Set Good Start-Up OKRs

**DO:**
- Focus on product-market fit: growth, retention, revenue, usage
- Choose 2-3 metrics you look at every day anyway
- Pick targets that feel ambitious but possible (70-80% confidence)
- Update monthly as you learn
- Be honest when things aren't working

**DON'T:**
- Set 5+ objectives (you'll accomplish nothing)
- Track vanity metrics (downloads, page views, social followers)
- Set targets based on what sounds good to investors
- Keep pursuing an objective when evidence says pivot
- Forget to actually review and update them

**Start-Up Stage Examples:**

**Pre-Seed (Validating Idea):**
- Objective: Validate that users have this problem and want our solution
  - KR: 20 customer interviews completed
  - KR: 50 users sign up for beta waitlist
  - KR: 10 users willing to pay (even if product not ready)

**Seed (Finding PMF):**
- Objective: Prove users will engage with and pay for our product
  - KR: 500 weekly active users
  - KR: 30% day-7 retention
  - KR: 20 paying customers, $5K MRR

**Seed+ (Scaling PMF):**
- Objective: Scale what's working
  - KR: 2,000 weekly active users
  - KR: 50% day-7 retention (improving quality)
  - KR: $25K MRR, 10% month-over-month growth

<!-- LLM: When helping start-ups set OKRs, ask: "What would prove product-market fit for you?" "What metric do you check every morning?" "If you could only move one number this quarter, what would it be?" These questions reveal what actually matters vs what they think they should track. -->
