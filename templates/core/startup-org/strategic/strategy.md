# Company Strategy

<!-- LLM: For start-ups, strategy is about finding product-market fit, not market domination. Keep this practical: target market, go-to-market approach, competitive positioning, and how you'll know if it's working. Update quarterly as you learn. Help founders be honest about what they don't know yet. -->

**Status:** Living | **Update Frequency:** Quarterly
**Primary Roles:** Founder/CEO, Co-founders
**Related Documents:** `/strategic/vision-and-mission.md`, `/strategic/objectives-and-key-results.md`, `/strategic/roadmap.md`

## Purpose

Your strategy is your plan for achieving product-market fit and building a sustainable business. At your stage, strategy is less about long-term planning and more about:
1. **Who** you're targeting
2. **What** problem you're solving
3. **How** you'll reach and win customers
4. **Why** they'll choose you over alternatives
5. **When** you'll know if it's working

**Start-Up Reality:** Your strategy will evolve rapidly. That's normal. Update this quarterly based on what you learn from customers.

## Strategic Overview

**Current Stage:** [Pre-Seed / Seed / Seed+]
**Primary Focus:** [Product-Market Fit / Scaling PMF / Fundraising / Other]
**Time Horizon:** [Next 6-12 months]

**One-Sentence Strategy:**

[Describe your strategy in one sentence: who you serve, what you do, how you win]

<!-- Example: "We're building the fastest way for mid-market SaaS companies to add AI features, competing on speed and ease-of-use rather than customization." -->

---

## Market and Opportunity

### Target Market

**Who We're Targeting (Ideal Customer Profile):**

[Describe your ideal customer. Be specific: company size, role, industry, etc.]

<!-- Example:
- Engineering teams at Series A-C startups (10-100 engineers)
- Companies with existing web products looking to add AI
- Primarily B2B SaaS, especially in productivity and workflow tools
- Technical decision-maker: VP Eng or Director of Engineering
-->

**Market Size:**

[What's the opportunity? Keep this simple and honest.]

<!-- Example:
- 50,000+ venture-backed startups globally
- ~5,000 are in our sweet spot (Series A-C, 10-100 engineers, B2B SaaS)
- If we capture 5% (250 companies) at $50K ACV = $12.5M ARR
-->

**Why Now?**

[Why is this the right time for your solution? What changed?]

<!-- Example:
- AI capabilities have reached production quality in last 18 months
- Every SaaS company now facing "add AI features" pressure from customers
- Existing solutions require ML expertise companies don't have
- New LLM APIs make this technically feasible for the first time
-->

### Problem We're Solving

**Customer Pain Points:**

[List the top 2-3 problems your customers face. Use their words, not yours.]

1. [Primary pain point]
2. [Secondary pain point]
3. [Third pain point if critical]

<!-- Example:
1. "We want to add AI to our product but don't have ML engineers"
2. "Hiring ML talent takes 6+ months and costs $300K+ per hire"
3. "Existing solutions lock us into specific infrastructure or require PhD-level knowledge"
-->

**Current Alternatives:**

[How do customers solve this today? Be honest about competition.]

- **Alternative 1:** [What they do now]
  - **Pros:** [Why some customers choose this]
  - **Cons:** [Why this doesn't fully solve the problem]

<!-- Example:
- Alternative 1: Hire ML engineers
  - Pros: Full control, custom solutions
  - Cons: Expensive ($300K/year), slow (6+ months to hire), hard to find

- Alternative 2: OpenAI API directly
  - Pros: Easy to start, powerful
  - Cons: Hard to productionize, no guardrails, expensive at scale

- Alternative 3: Do nothing, delay AI features
  - Pros: No investment required
  - Cons: Falling behind competitors, losing deals
-->

## Our Solution and Positioning

### What We Do

[Describe your solution in simple terms. 2-3 sentences max.]

<!-- Example: "We provide a platform that lets developers add AI capabilities to their applications through simple APIs. No ML expertise required. Works with any tech stack. Production-ready from day one." -->

### How We're Different (Positioning)

**Our Unique Approach:**

[What makes you different from alternatives? Be specific and honest.]

<!-- Example:
- **vs Hiring ML Engineers:** 10x faster (days not months), 10x cheaper ($5K/month not $300K/year)
- **vs Direct LLM APIs:** Production-ready with built-in guardrails, monitoring, and optimization
- **vs ML Platforms:** Simple APIs not complex pipelines, no ML expertise needed
-->

**Why Customers Choose Us:**

[What do customers say when they pick you?]

1. [Primary reason, in customer's words]
2. [Secondary reason]
3. [Third reason]

<!-- Example:
1. "We shipped AI features in 2 days instead of 6 months"
2. "It actually works in production without ML expertise"
3. "Cost is 1/10th of hiring ML engineers"
-->

**Our Wedge (How We Get In):**

[What's the first thing customers buy? What gets you in the door?]

<!-- Example: "Companies start with our 'smart search' API to improve their product search. Once that's working, they add autocomplete, recommendations, then more complex AI features." -->

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### How We Acquire Customers

**Primary Channel:** [What's your main growth channel?]

<!-- Example: "Developer-led: Engineers discover us via documentation, tutorials, and GitHub. They try it, love it, then convince their VP Eng to adopt company-wide." -->

**Customer Acquisition Plan:**

1. **[Channel 1]:**
   - Tactic: [What you're doing]
   - Why: [Why you think this will work]
   - Metric: [How you'll measure success]

2. **[Channel 2]:**
   - Tactic:
   - Why:
   - Metric:

<!-- Example:
1. **Content Marketing (SEO):**
   - Tactic: Write tutorials on "How to add AI to [popular framework]"
   - Why: Developers google this when tasked with adding AI features
   - Metric: 10K organic visitors/month, 5% sign-up rate

2. **Developer Community:**
   - Tactic: Active in AI/ML Discord, Reddit, and Stack Overflow
   - Why: Developers ask for recommendations here
   - Metric: 100 community-driven sign-ups/month
-->

**Sales Model:**

[How do you sell? Self-serve? Sales-assisted? Enterprise sales?]

<!-- Example: "Self-serve with sales-assist for $50K+ deals. Developers can start free, swipe credit card for production. Sales team engages when usage hits $5K/month or they request enterprise features." -->

**Customer Journey:**

[Map the typical path from awareness to paying customer]

```
Discover → Try Free → Get Value → Convert → Expand
[Where]    [What]     [When]      [Why]     [How]
```

<!-- Example:
Discover (Google, community) → Sign Up Free (5 min) → First API Call (day 1) →
Get Value (working feature in 2 days) → Convert to Paid (hit rate limits) →
Expand Usage (add more features)
-->

## Competitive Strategy

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**

- **[Competitor 1]:** [What they do, their strength, their weakness]
- **[Competitor 2]:** [What they do, their strength, their weakness]

<!-- Example:
- **OpenAI API:** Most powerful models, but hard to productionize and expensive at scale
- **HuggingFace:** Open source flexibility, but requires ML expertise to deploy
-->

**Indirect Competitors:**

- **[Alternative 1]:** [e.g., "Hiring ML engineers"]
- **[Alternative 2]:** [e.g., "Building in-house platform"]

### How We Win

**Short-term (Next 6 months):**

[What's your strategy to win in the next 6 months?]

<!-- Example: "Be the easiest way to get AI working in production. Win on speed and simplicity, not customization. Target mid-market who can't afford to build custom." -->

**Medium-term (6-18 months):**

[Once you have initial traction, how do you expand?]

<!-- Example: "Expand from 'smart search' wedge to full AI platform. Add more use cases (recommendations, autocomplete, classification). Build network effects through shared learnings." -->

**Defensibility:**

[What will prevent others from copying you?]

<!-- Example:
- Data: Proprietary optimizations learned from thousands of customer deployments
- Switching costs: Once integrated into product, hard to swap out
- Network effects: Shared learnings improve the platform for everyone
-->

---

## Product Strategy

### Product Vision (12 months)

[Where is the product heading? What will it look like in 12 months?]

<!-- Example: "Platform that handles all common AI use cases for SaaS products (search, recommendations, classification, generation) with 5-minute integration and production-grade reliability." -->

### Build vs Buy vs Partner

[What will you build? What will you integrate? What will you partner on?]

<!-- Example:
- **Build:** Developer experience, API layer, production infrastructure, monitoring
- **Buy/Integrate:** Underlying LLM models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Partner:** Customer auth/billing systems, deployment platforms
-->

### Product Priorities

**Must Have (Next 3 months):**
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]
- [Priority 3]

**Should Have (3-6 months):**
- [Priority 4]
- [Priority 5]

**Nice to Have (6-12 months):**
- [Priority 6]
- [Priority 7]

## Financial Strategy

### Revenue Model

**How We Make Money:**

[Describe your pricing/revenue model simply]

<!-- Example: "Usage-based pricing: $0.10 per AI API call + $500/month platform fee for production usage. Starts free for development." -->

**Unit Economics (Current or Target):**

- **Average Revenue Per Customer:** $[X]/month
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** $[Y]
- **CAC Payback Period:** [Z] months
- **Gross Margin:** [%]

<!-- LLM: For very early start-ups, these might be "TBD" or estimates. That's okay. Help them think through what they need to learn. -->

### Funding Strategy

**Current Funding Status:** [Pre-seed / Seed raised / Fundraising / Bootstrapped]

**Runway:** [Months of runway remaining]

**Next Milestone:** [What do you need to achieve to raise next round or become profitable?]

<!-- Example: "Need to reach $50K MRR with 20% month-over-month growth to raise Series A. Current: $15K MRR, 30% MoM. 12 months of runway." -->

**Burn Rate:** $[X]/month

**Path to Profitability or Next Round:**

[What needs to happen? Be specific.]

<!-- Example: "Reach $100K MRR (need 200 customers at $500/month avg). At current 30% MoM growth, that's 10 months. Will need to raise in 8 months to have buffer." -->
