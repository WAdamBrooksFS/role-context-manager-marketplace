# Company Roadmap

<!-- LLM: For start-ups, roadmap should be 3-6 month rolling view, not annual. Update weekly based on customer feedback. Help founders balance "what we want to build" with "what customers actually need." Everything on this roadmap should connect to finding/scaling product-market fit. -->

**Status:** Living | **Update Frequency:** Weekly
**Primary Roles:** Founder/CEO, Product Co-founder, Technical Co-founder
**Related Documents:** `/strategic/strategy.md`, `/strategic/objectives-and-key-results.md`, `/product/feature-specs/`

## Purpose

The roadmap shows what you're building in the next 3-6 months to achieve product-market fit. At your stage, this is a living document that changes based on customer feedback.

**Start-Up Reality:**
- This will change every week - that's normal
- Most items here will ship differently than planned
- Some will be dropped entirely based on what you learn
- Focus on learning, not shipping according to plan

---

## Current Focus: [One sentence - what are you optimizing for right now?]

<!-- Example: "Getting first 100 customers to 'aha moment' within 5 minutes of sign-up." -->

**Last Updated:** [Date]

---

## Now (Current Sprint/Week - Next 1-2 Weeks)

**Goal:** [What are you trying to achieve or learn this sprint?]

<!-- Example: "Reduce time-to-first-API-call from 20 minutes to 5 minutes. Learn: does faster onboarding improve conversion?" -->

### In Progress
- [ ] **[Feature/Task 1]** - [Owner] - [Why this matters]
  - Status: [In dev / In review / Testing]
  - Link: [Link to feature spec or GitHub issue]

- [ ] **[Feature/Task 2]** - [Owner] - [Why this matters]
  - Status:
  - Link:

<!-- Example:
- [ ] **Interactive API playground** - Technical Co-founder - Makes first API call instant, no setup
  - Status: In dev, ships Friday
  - Link: feature-specs/api-playground.md

- [ ] **Onboarding video (2 min)** - Product Co-founder - Shows value before they code
  - Status: In review
  - Link: feature-specs/onboarding-video.md
-->

### Customer Feedback We're Acting On
- [Quote from customer or insight from user research]
- [What you're doing about it]

<!-- Example:
- "I gave up after getting API key errors for 10 minutes" (3 users this week)
  - → Building better error messages and API key validation

- "I don't understand when I would use this vs OpenAI directly" (5 users)
  - → Adding comparison page and use case examples
-->

---

## Next (Next 2-4 Weeks)

**Goal:** [What are you trying to achieve or learn next?]

### Planned
- **[Feature 1]** - [Owner] - [Why]
  - Link: [Feature spec if exists]

- **[Feature 2]** - [Owner] - [Why]
  - Link:

<!-- Example:
- **Usage dashboard** - Founding Engineer - Customers want to see what they're using/spending
- **Slack integration** - Founding Engineer - #1 requested feature, helps virality
- **Custom model support** - Technical Co-founder - Enterprise asks, opens $50K+ deals
-->

### Customer Requests (Prioritized)
1. [Request 1] - [# of customers who asked] - [Revenue impact]
2. [Request 2] - [# of customers] - [Impact]
3. [Request 3] - [# of customers] - [Impact]

### Experiments We Want to Run
- [Hypothesis 1: If we do X, we expect Y to happen]
- [Hypothesis 2]

<!-- Example:
- If we add templates for common use cases, we expect 50% more users to complete first integration
- If we show pricing upfront, we expect fewer surprised customers hitting rate limits
-->

---

## Later (1-3 Months Out)

**Themes:** [What are the big areas you'll focus on?]

<!-- Example: "1) Onboarding & activation, 2) Enterprise features for larger deals, 3) Developer tools & DX" -->

### Product Themes

**Theme 1: [Name]**
- Why: [Why this theme matters]
- Features:
  - [Feature idea 1]
  - [Feature idea 2]
  - [Feature idea 3]

<!-- Example:
Theme 1: Enterprise Readiness
- Why: Need $50K+ deals to hit revenue targets, enterprise customers need these features
- Features:
  - SSO / SAML integration
  - SOC 2 compliance
  - Custom SLAs and dedicated support
  - On-premise deployment option
-->

**Theme 2: [Name]**
- Why:
- Features:

**Theme 3: [Name]**
- Why:
- Features:

### Big Bets (Uncertain Timeline)
- [Big idea 1] - [Why this could be huge] - [Why we're not sure yet]
- [Big idea 2] - [Why] - [Uncertainty]

<!-- Example:
- Multi-player collaboration features - Could drive team adoption and virality - Don't know if teams actually build AI features together yet
- Marketplace of community templates - Could create network effects - Need more users first
-->

## Future / Icebox (3-6 Months or More)

<!-- LLM: Encourage start-ups to keep this section light. It's a dumping ground for "someday" ideas, but shouldn't be a commitment. -->

**Ideas We Like But Not Now:**
- [Idea 1] - [Why not now]
- [Idea 2] - [Why not now]

<!-- Example:
- Mobile SDK - Need web/API product-market fit first
- AI model training - Too complex for current customers, maybe in 12 months
- White-label solution - Interesting business model, but distracts from core product
-->

**Things We've Decided NOT to Build:**
- [Idea 1] - [Why we said no]
- [Idea 2] - [Why we said no]

<!-- Example:
- WordPress plugin - Not our target customer (too small, low ACV)
- Free tier - Attracts tire-kickers, not serious developers. Free trial is enough.
-->

---

## Roadmap Prioritization Framework

<!-- LLM: Help start-ups be disciplined about what gets on the roadmap. Everything should tie to OKRs and product-market fit. -->

**We prioritize features that:**
1. **Move our OKR metrics** - Does it improve activation, retention, or revenue?
2. **Customers are asking for** - Multiple paying customers requested it
3. **Differentiate us** - Makes us clearly better than alternatives
4. **Unblock revenue** - Removes barrier to signing deals

**We de-prioritize features that:**
1. **Are "nice to have"** - We think it's cool but customers don't ask
2. **Take too long** - Anything >2 weeks should be broken down
3. **Distract from core** - Shiny objects that don't serve our strategy
4. **Optimize too early** - Premature scaling/optimization

**Questions We Ask:**
- Will this help us find product-market fit faster?
- Did a customer actually ask for this, or did we imagine it?
- Can we test the hypothesis with a simpler version?
- What's the smallest thing we can ship to learn?

## Roadmap Changes Log

<!-- LLM: Encourage start-ups to track major roadmap pivots. Helps see patterns in what customers actually want vs what you thought. -->

### [Date]
- **Dropped:** [What we stopped working on] - **Why:** [Reason]
- **Added:** [What we added] - **Why:** [Reason]
- **Pivoted:** [What changed] - **Why:** [Reason]

<!-- Example:
### 2024-11-15
- **Dropped:** Mobile SDK - **Why:** No customer requests, web/API is the priority
- **Added:** Slack integration - **Why:** 5 customers asked this week, helps virality
- **Pivoted:** From custom model training to custom model support - **Why:** Customers want to bring their own models, not train new ones
-->

## How We Use This Roadmap

**Weekly Roadmap Review:**
- What shipped this week?
- What did we learn?
- Do we need to reprioritize based on customer feedback?
- What's blocked?

**Monthly Roadmap Refresh:**
- Review "Now" and "Next" sections
- Move completed items to "Shipped" (create a log if needed)
- Update priorities based on OKR progress
- Add new customer requests

**Don't:**
- Share specific dates with customers (say "soon" or "next quarter")
- Commit to more than 2-4 weeks out
- Build features just because they're "on the roadmap"
- Ignore customer feedback that contradicts the plan

---

## Shipped (Recent Wins)

<!-- LLM: Keeping a "shipped" section helps maintain momentum and morale. Celebrate what you've built. -->

### [Month Year]
- **[Feature 1]** - [Impact: what happened after shipping?]
- **[Feature 2]** - [Impact]

<!-- Example:
### November 2024
- **Interactive docs** - Sign-up-to-first-API-call time dropped from 20 min to 5 min
- **Billing dashboard** - Support tickets about billing dropped 60%
- **Python SDK** - 30% of new sign-ups now use Python (was 0%)
-->

## Roadmap Communication

**Internal:**
- Reviewed weekly in team standup
- Updated in real-time as priorities shift

**External (Customers/Investors):**
- **Customers:** Share high-level themes, not specific features/dates
- **Investors:** Monthly update includes roadmap progress and pivots

**Public:**
- We [do / don't] maintain a public roadmap
- [If yes: Link to public roadmap]

---

**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Next Review:** [Date - should be weekly]
**Document Owner:** Product Co-founder (or Founder/CEO if no product co-founder)

<!-- LLM: When helping founders with roadmap, focus on learning over shipping. Ask: "What do you need to learn?" "What would make customers love this?" "What's the smallest version you can ship?" Encourage weekly updates and brutal honesty about what's working vs not. The roadmap should serve product-market fit, not ego. -->
