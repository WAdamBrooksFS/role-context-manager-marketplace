# Investor Updates Template

<!-- LLM: Help founders write concise, honest, regular investor updates. Best updates share wins AND challenges. Format should be scannable in 2-3 minutes. Monthly cadence builds trust. Encourage transparency - investors want to help with problems, not just hear good news. -->

## Best Practices for Investor Updates

### DO:
- **Be consistent**: Same metrics month-over-month
- **Be honest**: Share challenges, not just wins
- **Be specific in asks**: "Intro to enterprise sales reps" not "any helpful intros"
- **Be brief**: 3-5 minute read max
- **Be regular**: Monthly cadence builds trust
- **Show learnings**: What you learned from failures
- **Include context**: Why metrics moved (up or down)

### DON'T:
- Skip months (even slow months - just be honest)
- Only share good news (investors want real picture)
- Make vague asks ("any intros helpful")
- Write a novel (respect their time)
- Cherry-pick metrics (show consistent set)
- Hide problems until they're crises

---

## Who to Send Updates To

**Always:**
- Current investors (angels, VCs)
- Board members and advisors
- Close supporters who helped you

**Sometimes:**
- Potential investors you're warming up
- Strategic partners
- Influential supporters

**Never:**
- Publicly (unless you want it public)
- To competitors (be mindful of forwarding)
