# Pitch Deck Guide

<!-- LLM: Help founders craft compelling, honest pitch decks. Focus on storytelling, not just facts. The best decks tell a story: problem → solution → why now → why us → traction → vision. Keep founders honest - avoid hype, showcase real progress. -->

**Status:** Living | **Update Frequency:** As needed (before each fundraise)
**Primary Roles:** Founder/CEO, Co-founders
**Related Documents:** `/strategic/vision-and-mission.md`, `/strategic/strategy.md`, `/fundraising/investor-updates-template.md`

## Purpose

Your pitch deck tells your company's story to investors. It should inspire, inform, and lead to a follow-up conversation. At the pre-seed/seed stage, investors bet on team, market, and early traction - not financials or detailed plans.

**Start-Up Reality:**
- Your deck will evolve for each investor (slight customization)
- First version will be imperfect - that's okay
- Fundraising takes 3-6 months typically
- Expect to iterate the deck 10+ times based on feedback

---

## Pitch Deck Structure (10-15 Slides)

### Slide 1: Company Vision / Hook
**Purpose:** Grab attention in first 10 seconds

**What to include:**
- Company name and one-liner
- Founder names and email
- A bold, aspirational vision statement

**Example:**
```
[Company Name]
"Making AI accessible to every developer"

[email]
```

**Tips:**

Developers want to add AI to their products, but...

❌ "Hiring ML engineers takes 6+ months and costs $300K/year"
❌ "Existing tools require PhD-level knowledge we don't have"
❌ "OpenAI APIs are great for demos but hard to productionize"

→ Result: Companies delay AI features for months or years
```

## Pitch Deck Best Practices

### Design
- **Clean and simple**: Don't clutter slides
- **Visual-first**: Use images, charts, screenshots - not walls of text
- **Consistent style**: Use template, consistent fonts/colors
- **Readable**: Large fonts (24pt minimum), high contrast
- **Professional but authentic**: Don't over-design

### Content
- **Tell a story**: Problem → Solution → Why Us → Traction → Vision
- **Be concise**: 10-15 slides max for initial deck
- **Use data**: Specific numbers, not vague claims
- **Show, don't tell**: Screenshots, customer quotes, growth graphs
- **Be honest**: Don't overhype or hide challenges

### Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Too many slides (>20 slides for initial pitch)
- ❌ Walls of text (slides should be scannable in 5 seconds)
- ❌ No traction (even small numbers matter)
- ❌ Unclear ask (be specific about raise amount)
- ❌ Generic market size ("$1T TAM")
- ❌ No differentiation (why not just use [competitor]?)
- ❌ Weak team slide (this is critical for seed)
- ❌ Ignoring competition ("we have no competitors")
