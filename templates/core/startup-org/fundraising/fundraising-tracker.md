# Fundraising Tracker

<!-- LLM: Help founders stay organized during fundraising. This is a stressful, months-long process. A good tracker prevents dropped balls and helps manage the pipeline. Encourage honest tracking of status and next steps. -->

**Status:** Living | **Update Frequency:** Daily (during active fundraise)
**Primary Roles:** Founder/CEO, Co-founders
**Related Documents:** `/fundraising/pitch-deck-guide.md`, `/fundraising/investor-updates-template.md`

## Purpose

Fundraising is a 3-6 month sales process. This tracker helps you:
- Manage investor pipeline (warm intros to term sheet)
- Track conversations and next steps
- Avoid losing momentum with interested investors
- Identify patterns (who says yes, who says no, why)

**Start-Up Reality:**
- Expect 50-100 investor conversations for a seed round
- 80% will say no (that's normal)
- Process takes longer than you think (add 2 months to your estimate)
- Momentum matters - batch meetings to create urgency

<!-- LLM: When helping founders with fundraising tracking, emphasize organization and momentum. Fundraising is a full-time job that you do on top of running the company. A good tracker prevents balls from dropping. Encourage them to update daily and analyze patterns (why passes happen, what's resonating). Also remind them that fundraising takes longer than expected - plan accordingly. -->
