## Later ([Future Quarter] and Beyond)

### [Quarter]: [Theme]

**Initiatives Under Consideration:**
- [Initiative idea 1] - [Why we might do it]
- [Initiative idea 2] - [Why we might do it]
- [Initiative idea 3] - [Why we might do it]

**Decision Factors:**
- [What would make us prioritize these]

<!-- Example:
### Q4 2024: Platform Ecosystem

**Initiatives Under Consideration:**
- **Public API Marketplace** - Allow third-party developers to build on our platform (monetization opportunity, ecosystem lock-in)
- **Multi-Region Active-Active** - Deploy to 5 global regions with active-active architecture (enterprise requirement for global customers)
- **Advanced Analytics Suite** - Built-in BI/analytics for AI application usage (customer-requested, competitive gap)

**Decision Factors:**
- Enterprise customer demands (if 5+ customers request, we prioritize)
- Competitive pressure (if competitors launch similar, we accelerate)
- Technical dependencies (some require Q3 infrastructure work to complete first)
-->

### [Later Quarter]: [Theme]

**Initiatives Under Consideration:**

## How System/Product Roadmaps Connect

This company roadmap provides strategic direction. Lower-level roadmaps provide implementation details:

### System Roadmaps
**Location:** `system-template/roadmap.md`
**Purpose:** Shows how system-level initiatives support company initiatives
**Update Frequency:** Monthly
**Audience:** Engineering managers, system architects

### Product Roadmaps
**Location:** `product-*-template/roadmap.md`
**Purpose:** Feature-level details for specific products
**Update Frequency:** Weekly (for active development)
**Audience:** Product managers, engineering teams, customers (sometimes)

**Cascade Example:**
```
Company Initiative: "SOC2 Type II Certification" (this document)
    ↓
System Initiative: "Security Infrastructure Overhaul" (system-template/roadmap.md)
    ↓
Product Features: "Audit Logging UI", "Compliance Dashboard" (product-*/roadmap.md)
    ↓
Project Work: Specific RFCs, PRDs, technical designs (project-*/docs/)
```

## Roadmap Principles

### How We Prioritize
1. **Strategic Alignment**: Does it support our strategic pillars? (see `/strategy.md`)
2. **Customer Impact**: Does it unblock revenue or prevent churn?
3. **Dependencies**: What else depends on this?
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Does it reduce existential risk?
5. **Resource Availability**: Do we have the right team to execute?

### What Gets Cut
- Features that don't align with strategic pillars
- "Nice to have" improvements when resources are constrained
- Initiatives with unclear success metrics
- Work that duplicates partner/vendor capabilities

### How We Communicate Changes
- **Major changes** (adding/removing initiatives): Announced in all-hands, updated here
- **Timeline shifts**: Updated in this document + communicated to affected teams
- **Completions**: Celebrated in team updates, marked complete here

<!-- LLM: When reviewing PRDs, RFCs, or project plans, check if they connect to initiatives on this roadmap. If a substantial piece of work doesn't connect to any roadmap item, flag it - it might be out of scope or the roadmap needs updating. Roadmap should be ambitious but achievable - if >30% of initiatives are marked "At Risk", suggest a prioritization discussion. -->
