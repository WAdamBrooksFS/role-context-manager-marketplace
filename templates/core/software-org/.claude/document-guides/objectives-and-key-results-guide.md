## OKR Principles
- **Objectives** are qualitative and aspirational
- **Key Results** are quantitative and measurable
- **3-5 objectives** max per level
- **2-4 key results** per objective
- OKRs cascade: Company → System → Product → Project work

## Creating OKRs

### Objectives (Qualitative)
**Good examples:**
- "Become the most trusted platform for developers"
- "Accelerate product development velocity"

**Bad examples:**
- "Increase NPS by 20 points" (that's a KR, not objective)
- "Do better" (too vague)

### Key Results (Quantitative)
**Must have:**
- Specific metric
- Baseline value
- Target value
- Current value (updated regularly)
- Owner

**Good example:**
- Metric: Developer NPS
- Baseline: 42 (Q1 2024)
- Target: 60
- Current: 51 (Week 8)
- Owner: Sarah Chen (CPO)

## Validation Rules

**AI MUST enforce:**
- [ ] Objectives are qualitative (no numbers)
- [ ] Key Results are quantitative (have numbers)
- [ ] Each KR has baseline, target, current, owner
- [ ] Lower-level OKRs explicitly link to higher-level
- [ ] Every OKR has an owner
- [ ] Update frequency is quarterly
- [ ] Proper approvals obtained

## Review Cadence

**Weekly:** Update current values
**Monthly:** Review progress, identify risks
**Quarterly:** Complete OKR review, set next quarter

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake:** Mixing objectives and key results
**Fix:** Objective = aspirational vision, KR = how we measure it

**Mistake:** Too many OKRs (10+ objectives)
**Fix:** Limit to 3-5 objectives, focus on what matters most

**Mistake:** Sandbagged targets (too easy)
**Fix:** OKRs should be ambitious (60-70% confident)

**Mistake:** Not updating current values
**Fix:** Update weekly, keep OKRs relevant
