## OKR Best Practices

### Good Objectives
- Aspirational and inspirational
- Qualitative (not numbers)
- Time-bound (this quarter)
- Ambitious but achievable

### Good Key Results
- Measurable with specific metrics
- Quantitative (includes numbers)
- Verifiable (yes/no: did we hit the target?)
- Have clear baseline, target, and current values

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Too many objectives (max 3-5)
- Key results that are actually tasks/projects
- Targets that are too easy (should be 60-70% confident)
- Not updating current values regularly
- OKRs that don't cascade down to teams

<!-- LLM: When creating system-level OKRs, ensure they explicitly link back to specific company objectives here. When reviewing PRDs or roadmaps, verify they support at least one key result. OKRs should be ambitious - suggest stretch targets, not sandbagged goals. -->
