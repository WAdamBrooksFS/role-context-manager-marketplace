# Company Strategy

<!-- LLM: This document defines the company's long-term strategic direction. When making architectural decisions, product prioritization, or resource allocation suggestions, ensure they align with the strategic pillars defined here. This is more stable than OKRs (which change quarterly) and should inform all major decisions. -->

**Status:** Living | **Update Frequency:** Quarterly (reviewed), Annual (major updates)
**Primary Roles:** CEO, C-Suite, VP/Director level leadership
**Related Documents:** `/objectives-and-key-results.md`, `/roadmap.md`, `/product-vision.md`

## Purpose

## Technology Strategy

### Technical Principles
[3-5 guiding principles for technical decisions]

<!-- Example:
1. **Cloud-Native First**: Build for Kubernetes, AWS/GCP-compatible
2. **API-First Architecture**: Every service is an API, internal and external
3. **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture, least privilege access
4. **Observable Systems**: Instrument everything, assume failures will happen
5. **Developer Velocity**: Optimize for speed of iteration, not perfection
-->

### Technology Stack Philosophy
**Approach:** [e.g., Best-of-breed, Standardized, etc.]

**Core Technologies:**
- [Technology category 1]: [Choice and why]
- [Technology category 2]: [Choice and why]

<!-- Example:
**Approach:** Best-of-breed with standardization where it matters

**Core Technologies:**
- **Backend**: Go for services (performance, simplicity), Python for ML (ecosystem)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (ecosystem, talent availability)
- **Data**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache), S3 (blob storage)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes on AWS (flexibility, enterprise requirement)
- **AI/ML**: LangChain abstraction layer (multi-model support)
-->

### Technical Debt Management
